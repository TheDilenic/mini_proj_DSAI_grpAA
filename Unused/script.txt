Model Used 2:

From the graph and the R^2 results, it shows that:

The Linear Regression model performed the best, achieving an R² close to 0.99 with a very low MAE.
This tells us that the relationship between development indicators and living standards is largely linear — meaning improvements in income, education, and health tend to have proportional impacts on SOL.

The Decision Tree model, on the other hand, overfitted the data — it learned patterns too specific to the training set, resulting in negative R² values.

The Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models performed moderately well, but not as efficiently as Linear Regression — likely because
our dataset was relatively small and clean, where simpler models generalised better.

Overall, our ML approach helps us quantify how social and environmental factors interact to shape living conditions across the world.”

The models we used — particularly Gradient Boosting — go beyond the techniques covered in class, allowing us to explore more complex, non-linear methods.

This helped us understand not just how each factor individually affects living standards, but how they interact — for example, how urbanisation and income together might offset the effects of climate stress in certain regions.”

Why Gradient Boosting:
    Handles complex non-linear relationships between features
    Strong predictive performance for continuous targets (SOL index)

Think of Gradient Boosting like a student who learns from each mistake to get better at predictions - it was particularly useful because it could capture complex relationships between climate and living standards."




Insights & Achieved Objective::

What does this mean for where we live?


“To show that we achieved our objective,
Climate change influences living standards through:

Infrastructure quality (roads, water systems)
Economic opportunities
Public health systems

However, our analysis shows that through efficient energy use and smart development, we can maintain good living standards while addressing climate challenge

Countries can improve living standards while addressing climate change by:

Investing in energy efficiency
Improving infrastructure resilience
Focusing on sustainable urban development

This gives policymakers and communities practical tools to make informed decisions about development and climate action.
