## To-Do Goals:

1. Re-adjust data variables to deal with missing data (either replace or increase weightage of other variables)
2. Do model trainings (Linear Regression, Classification, Clustering and ~~Anomaly Detection~~) ✅
3. find 'new' methods ✅

- finalise problem statement ✅
- list relevant data needed ✅
- 
- work allocation ✅

### Problem Statement: The Energy Efficiency Dilemma

Problem(s):

- How does climate change affect standard of living?
- And will this affect where I live?

Approach:

Create an energy efficiency index (GDP / Energy use per capita)

Use regression to model what drives energy efficiency

Cluster countries by efficiency performance

Why interesting:
Highlights innovation and policy success stories instead of just emission levels.

Relevant Data needed:

- monthly Income
- retirement
- good healthcare
- whether place is dirty
- how well a country is doing
- housing
- stability
- immigration

Exploratory Data Analysis findings and observations.

Why did we research this?

- To compare standard of living with other countries to Singapore's.
- To find why people move to certain countries

How do we find this?

- Created a Standard of Living index formula from existing variables
- Compare
