To-Do Goals:

- finalise problem statement
- list relevant data needed
- find 'new' methods
- work allocation



Problem Statement: The Energy Efficiency Gap

Problem:
Which countries achieve the highest energy efficiency â€” that is, generating high GDP with minimal energy use and emissions?

Approach:

Create an energy efficiency index (GDP / Energy use per capita)

Use regression to model what drives energy efficiency

Cluster countries by efficiency performance

Why interesting:
Highlights innovation and policy success stories instead of just emission levels.


Relevant Data needed: 

- energy usage
- GDP
- emission rates
- 

Exploratory Data Analysis findings and observations.



Methods Used(): to predict???? or measure? or detect why?

Regression & Clustering + new/not in course method
