### Problem Statement: The True Energy Efficiency Gap

Problem:
Which countries achieve the highest true energy efficiency — not just in terms of GDP per energy use, but also considering emissions intensity, renewable energy share, and technological innovation?
And how have these patterns evolved over time??

Approach:

Create an energy efficiency index (GDP / Energy use per capita)

Use regression to model what drives energy efficiency

Cluster countries by efficiency performance

Why interesting:
Highlights innovation and policy success stories instead of just emission levels.


Relevant Data needed: 

- energy usage
- GDP
- emission rates
1.Access to electricity
2.Foreign direct investment net in flow
3.Invest in energy w/ private participation

Exploratory Data Analysis findings and observations.
