### Problem Statement: 

# Climate Change and Standard of Living: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview

This research investigates the relationship between climate change indicators and standard of living across different countries, with a particular focus on energy efficiency and its impact on quality of life.

### Core Research Questions

1. How do climate change factors influence standard of living?
2. What is the relationship between energy efficiency and quality of life?
3. How do different countries cluster based on these metrics?

### Methodology

#### 1. Standard of Living Index (SOL)

Created a comprehensive index using weighted components:

* Education (15%): Primary completion rates
* Health (25%): Under-five mortality, Physician availability
* Income (25%): GNI per capita, Poverty rates
* Infrastructure (20%): Paved roads, Urban population
* Basic Services (15%): Water access, Sanitation

#### 2. Advanced Analytics

* **Gradient Boosting Regression** : Predicts SOL using climate indicators
* **PCA** : Reduces dimensionality of climate features
* **K-means Clustering** : Groups countries by performance
* **Decision Tree Analysis** : Classifies countries based on energy metrics

### Key Findings

1. **Energy Efficiency Impact**

* Strong correlation between energy efficiency and standard of living
* Countries with better energy efficiency tend to have higher SOL scores

2. **Climate Indicators**

* CO2 emissions per GDP shows significant relationship with SOL
* Energy use per GDP is a key predictor of living standards

3. **Country Clustering**

* Identified distinct groups of countries based on climate performance
* Clear patterns emerge in how countries balance development and sustainability

### Conclusions

1. **Development-Sustainability Balance**

* Countries must balance economic growth with environmental sustainability
* Energy efficiency is crucial for maintaining high living standards

2. **Policy Implications**

* Investment in energy efficiency can improve living standards
* Environmental policies need to consider social impact

3. **Future Outlook**

* Sustainable development requires integrated approach
* Energy efficiency improvements can lead to better living standards

### Research Value

* Provides quantitative framework for policy decisions
* Helps understand migration patterns
* Identifies successful development models
* Benchmarks countries against sustainable development goals

This research helps understand how climate change and energy policies affect quality of life, crucial for both policy makers and individuals making location decisions.
