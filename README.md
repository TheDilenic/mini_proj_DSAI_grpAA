### Problem Statement: The Energy Efficiency Dilemma 

Problem(s):
- How does climate change affect standard of living?
- And will this affect where I live?



Approach:

Create an energy efficiency index (GDP / Energy use per capita)

Use regression to model what drives energy efficiency

Cluster countries by efficiency performance

Why interesting:
Highlights innovation and policy success stories instead of just emission levels.


Relevant Data needed: 

- monthly Income
- retirement
- good healthcare
- whether place is dirty
- how well a country is doing
- housing
- stability
- tourism


Exploratory Data Analysis findings and observations.
